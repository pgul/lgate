1. Building.

./configure
make
make install

2. Update from older version.

./configure
make
make update

3. Configuring.

Inspect and edit /usr/local/etc/gate.conf, /usr/local/etc/confer.lst,
/usr/local/etc/route.cfg.

Add line
Mgateway,	P=/usr/local/bin/rel2fido, F=lsDFu, S=10, R=0, A=rel2fido -l $h $u
to your sendmail.cf, add line
.z2.fidonet.org	gateway:localhost
to your mailertable, then restart sendmail and rebuild mailertable.db
(usually by running `newmailertable`).

Check for access rights. It's possible to install rel2fido and attuucp
as setuid (I think, not suid root, but suid fnet:).

If you want to use attuucp, add line
fnet:	"| /usr/local/bin/attuucp -l"
to your /etc/aliases and run newaliases.
Another (and I think better) way is to create file ~fnet/.forward
contains ont line
"| /usr/local/bin/attuucp -l"
In this case attuucp will run from user fnet, and not daemon
or mail as at first case (running from aliases file).

For gating echomail you need:

   1. Subscribe to this newsgroup by cnews or mailnews (feed).
In last case feed user lgate. You can receive some newsgroups
by feed and another by cnews.
   2. Uncomment line "include confer.lst" in gate.conf and
setup gating newsgroups in confer.lst.
   3. Setup gate in your tosser, i.e. make a fake-link. Note, that
mail packets should not be compressed.
   4. Subscribe gate to all gating echoes.

Note! You can not gate echomail unless you give separate FTN-address
to your gate, you cannot share the same address between you and your
gate.

It's all.
